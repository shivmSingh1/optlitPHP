# how to run this project ?

Don't run this project using a live server because VS Code's Live Server extension is primarily designed for serving static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It doesn't directly support npm packages.

Live Server creates a basic local development server but does not run or manage npm packages as a Node.js environment does. 

Type > `npm run dev` in your vs code terminal it run your project locally. 

`To see the difference between Live Server and npm run dev, first start your project using Live Server and then click on the button named 'Show Toast'. After that, start your project using npm run dev and again click on the 'Show Toast' button. You'll notice the difference.`
